Relativity

Relativity is the idea that our perceptions and judgments are not absolute but are shaped by our unique vantage points and frames of reference. It’s the understanding that our experiences are subjective.

We each inhabit a particular web of experiences. This context shapes how we see the world, what we notice and overlook, and what we value and dismiss. Two people can look at the same event and come away with vastly different interpretations based on their unique frames of reference.

Consider two people standing in the same room: They each experience the same absolute temperature differently. One can feel hot while the other feels cold, even though the temperature is the same. Similarly, consider political debates: Our beliefs are shaped by our unique experiences and social contexts. A policy that seems like common sense to an urban progressive might feel like complete nonsense to a rural conservative, and vice versa. In this way, understanding relativity is key to fostering empathy and finding common ground. However, relativity is not the same as relativism—­ the idea that all perspectives are equally valid.

Recognizing the relativity of our perceptions doesn’t mean we don’t have to make judgments about validity. Instead, it’s a call to examine our assumptions, seek out diverse perspectives, and expand our frames of reference. We all have blind spots—­things we cannot see. Understanding that our perceptions are relative allows us to open ourselves to other ways of seeing. If you’re wondering where to get started, try asking others what they see that you can’t. Apply your judgment to their responses and update your beliefs accordingly.

Reciprocity

Reciprocity underlies everything from basic human kindness to the most complex systems of trade. At its core, reciprocity is the simple idea of treating others as they treat us—giving what we get. But from this simple principle grows a vast web of social interactions and expectations that shapes nearly every aspect of our lives.

Many people expect the world to just hand them things without effort. This is a poor strategy because it doesn’t align with the human behavior you can observe around you every day. Reciprocation teaches us that you are likely to receive the same if you give people cynicism and curtness or nothing at all. But if you give people an opportunity and the benefit of the doubt, you will, more often than not, be on the receiving end of the same behavior.

Become what you want to see in the world, and the world will return it to you. If you want an amazing relationship with your partner, be an amazing partner. If you want people to be thoughtful and kind to you, be thoughtful and kind to them. If you want people to listen to you, listen to them.

The best way to achieve success is to deserve success. Small changes in your actions change your entire world.

One of the biggest misperceptions about reciprocity is that people should sit around waiting for others to go first rather than unlocking the power of reciprocity in their favor by going positive and going first without expectation.

Reciprocity reminds us that our actions tend to come back on us. It’s an essential reminder that we are part of the world, and thus, our actions do not happen in isolation but are instead part of an interconnected web of effects.

Thermodynamics

Thermodynamics is the science of energy, heat, and work. It’s the set of physical laws that govern how energy moves and changes in the universe. Chances are, when you first came across the subject, it was dry, full of equations and abstract concepts. But the truth is thermodynamics is a useful intellectual framework for daily life. Not only can it reveal why your room gets messier over time, but it also explains why you should choose your friends wisely.

The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. This means that every joule of energy in the universe, every bit of heat and work and motion is part of an unbroken chain stretching back to the Big Bang.

When you hop on a flight that burns jet fuel, you’re tapping into energy captured by plants millions of years ago and stored in chemical bonds until it was transformed into heat and motion.

But while energy is conserved, it’s not always useful. That’s where the second law of thermodynamics comes in. It states that entropy—­ a measure of disorder—­ increases over time in any closed system. In other words, left on its own, the universe tends toward chaos. Your bedroom doesn’t clean itself—­ it takes energy and effort to maintain order. Stars burn out, structures crumble, and ice melts into water.

Entropy is the universe’s tax on time. The constant battle against entropy is the driving force behind much of what we do. The constant struggle between order and disorder is the source of change and progress.

While engineers and scientists use thermodynamics to design engines or calculate the energy requirements of a system, we can use it as a framework for understanding the deep interconnectedness of everything. When you feel the sun’s warmth on your skin, you’re experiencing the result of a thermodynamic process that began in the heart of a star ninety-three million miles away. When you watch a campfire burn down to embers, you’re witnessing the inexorable march of entropy in real-time.

Thermodynamics is the story of energy across time. We’re part of an energy story that stretches back to the dawn of time and reaches the farthest pockets of space. We can marvel that in a universe ruled by disorder, pockets of temporary order can emerge, whether it’s a clean room, a planet, or a civilization.

By understanding thermodynamics, we gain not just a technical toolbox but an appreciation for the beauty, complexity, and fragility of our very existence.

Inertia

Inertia is the stubborn resistance of the universe to change. It’s why objects at rest tend to stay at rest, and objects in motion tend to stay in motion. You can think of inertia as the guardian of the status quo.

At its core, inertia is a property of mass. The more massive an object is, the more it resists changes to its state of motion. A feather, with its tiny mass, is easily blown about by the slightest breeze. A boulder, on the other hand, requires a powerful force to get it moving. This is why it takes more effort to push a heavy cart than a light one, more energy to launch a rocket than to toss a ball.

But inertia isn’t just a physical phenomenon. It’s an illuminating lens to see habits, beliefs, and our resistance to change. The longer we’ve held them, the larger the mass and the more force required to change them. The path of least resistance is always the status quo.

Getting started is the hardest part. Once something moves in a direction, keeping it in motion is much easier. But once something is in motion, it’s hard to stop. This is why most self-­help books about positive habits break things down into very small steps—­to reduce the force required to overcome the status quo. For example, if you want to get in the habit of doing push-­ups daily, start with one rather than fifty. If you want to start a flossing habit, start with one tooth. After all, the bigger the mass—­in this case, the gap between where you are and where you want to be—­ the more effort required.

Inertia is both a challenge and an opportunity. Successful companies struggle with the inertia of their success and the resistance to change that comes with size, complexity, and entrenched interests. On the other hand, startups can leverage their lack of inertia—­their agility, their willingness to pivot and adapt—­as a competitive advantage.

Momentum and inertia are closely related. While inertia is the tendency to resist change, momentum is the oomph an object has when it’s moving. The more momentum something has, the harder it is to stop or redirect. The key is to pick the right direction and build momentum so inertia works to your advantage and carries you forward. This is the essence of the “flywheel” concept in business—success breeds success, and small wins compound into big gains.

When you’re fighting the status quo, remember the physics at play. Resistance is natural. Understand that building momentum in a new direction takes a sustained force. While the universe resists change, it always rewards those who dare to overcome that resistance.

Friction and Viscosity

Friction and viscosity are the sand in the gears of the universe, the invisible hands that slow the motion of all things.

Friction is the grip between surfaces in contact, the roughness that resists sliding. Viscosity is the thickness of fluids, the internal friction that makes liquids sluggish and syrupy. Together, they are the great moderators of motion.

Think of the last time you tried to slide a heavy piece of furniture across the floor. The resistance you felt, the effort required to overcome the grip of the surface—­ that was friction at work. Or consider the slow, thick pour of honey from a jar, the way it clings and drips in slow threads. That’s the viscosity of the fluid resisting the force of gravity, the internal friction that makes the honey flow like molasses rather than water.

While friction is the enemy of efficiency, it’s also necessary for traction. We couldn’t walk, hold tools, or tie knots without it. Viscosity, too, is a double-­edged sword. In pipelines and hydraulic systems, high viscosity means higher pumping costs, slower flows, and greater strain on equipment. But viscosity also makes oil a good lubricant, allowing paints and coatings to spread evenly and adhere to surfaces.

Friction and viscosity are powerful metaphors for the forces of resistance in every domain of life. In human relationships, friction is the conflict and tension that arises from differing goals, personalities, or beliefs. The interpersonal roughness can generate heat and wear, but also the traction that allows us to influence and connect with others.

While often hidden, friction and viscosity work against us whenever we try to do something. We often default to using more force to overcome resistance when simply reducing the friction or viscosity will do. However, doing both is more effective than either in isolation.

Friction and viscosity can also be wielded as weapons. Rather than try to catch up to the competition with more effort, you might want to explore slowing them down by adding resistance through increased regulation, bureaucracy, or other clever ideas. In the end, reducing resistance is often easier than adding force.

Velocity

Velocity is the great differentiator, distinguishing the stagnant from the swift.

In physics, velocity is a fundamental quantity, a key variable in the equations that describe the behavior of everything from subatomic particles to galaxies. It’s the v in the formulas of motion, the arrow that points the way from here to there.

Velocity is also a metaphor for life. Consider it the rate at which we learn and grow, the speed at which we innovate and create, and the focus with which we pursue our goals.

Velocity challenges us to think about what we can do to put ourselves on the right trajectory and to find a balance between mass and speed to move toward our goals. The ability to set a direction, improve your tactics, and adjust to new information becomes paramount.

Velocity isn’t just about raw speed. Direction matters just as much (if not more). A car moving at high speed in circles goes nowhere, while a slow and steady walk in a straight line can cross continents.

Velocity is progress. Sometimes, progress comes from more force, and sometimes, progress comes from removing friction. Once you have a destination, you can improve your velocity by working harder and eliminating things that aren’t contributing toward reaching that goal.

Leverage

Leverage is the force multiplier of the world, the principle that allows the small to move the large and the few to influence the many. It’s the idea that a little force, strategically applied, can yield outsize outputs.

At its core, leverage is amplification. Think of a crowbar prying two boards apart or a pulley system hoisting a heavy load. In each case, the appled force is multiplied. But leverage isn’t just useful in physics. Rather, it’s a principle that applies across our lives.

Leverage is often lurking in the background of nonlinear outcomes. Consider the author who took the ideas in their head, put them in a book, and sold millions of copies, or the Wall Street investor who made a single decision that resulted in billions. Or even the CEO who directs the people working for them. All of these examples are leverage in action.

In personal development, leverage is about identifying the key habits, skills, and relationships that will impact your life and work most. It’s about focusing your energy on the critical few rather than the trivial many, about finding the points of maximum leverage where small changes can cascade into massive results.

An example of personal leverage is an employee who learns to use AI to amplify their impact on the organization far beyond their experience or effort. While labor is still a form of leverage, it can often be done with silicon chips. In this sense, the person who can leverage technology can compete in a way never imaginable.

However, leverage is not without its risks and responsibilities. Just as a small action can have an outsized positive impact, so can it have negative consequences. If you borrow too much money against your house and it turns out to be less valuable than assumed or interest rates change, the downside of leverage can quickly wipe you out.

Good ideas taken too far often cause unanticipated consequences. Wielding leverage to maximum effect all the time, as the West Virginia mine owners did, sows the seeds of ongoing unrest that undermines one’s ability to be truly effective. No one wants to feel exploited, and those who are never give their loyalty or their best work.

The key is to use leverage wisely and judiciously by understanding the systems you want to influence and considering the second- and third-­ order effects of your actions.

Leverage is a tool, not a toy, and like any tool, it requires skill, judgment, and respect.

Activation Energy

Activation energy is the spark that ignites the fire of change, the initial burst of effort required to kick-­ start a reaction or transformation. It’s the metaphorical push that gets the boulder rolling down the hill, the investment of energy needed to overcome inertia and set a process in motion.

In chemistry, activation energy is the minimum energy that must be input for a reaction. It’s the hurdle molecules must overcome to break their bonds and form new ones, the energetic barrier separating the reactants from the products.

But activation energy isn’t just a chemical concept. It’s a principle that applies to any system where change is possible but not automatic. In personal growth, activation energy is the effort required to break old habits and form new ones. In innovation, it’s the investment needed to turn an idea into reality.

The key is recognizing activation energy for what it is: a necessary upfront cost, not a permanent obstacle. Once things are moving, momentum takes over. Once the reaction starts, it becomes self-­ sustaining.

Catalysts

Catalysts are the unsung heroes of chemical reactions, the silent partners accelerating change. By decreasing the time required to cause change, they also make reactions possible that might not have occurred otherwise.

In chemistry, a catalyst is a substance that increases the reaction rate without permanently altering itself. But catalysts aren’t just chemical curiosities, they’re a powerful metaphor for the forces that drive change and growth.

In business, a catalyst might be a new technology that opens fresh possibilities or a visionary leader who inspires a team to new heights. In your personal life, a catalyst could be a life-­changing book, a transformative experience, or a mentor who sees your potential and helps you realize it.

Of course, while we benefit from others acting as our catalysts, we can be catalysts ourselves—helping others find the activation energy they need to thrive.

Alloying

Alloying is the art of mixing elements to create something greater than the sum of its parts. While our intuition tells us that pure substances are best, alloying shows this is not always true. One plus one can equal ten. By blending ingredients in precise proportions, metallurgists can create materials with bespoke properties—the lightness of aluminum with the strength of steel, the corrosion resistance of chromium with the affordability of iron.

But alloying isn’t just about physical properties. It’s a metaphor for the power of diversity and combination in all walks of life. In teams, alloying is the mixing of different skills, perspectives, and personalities to create a more creative, adaptable, and resilient group than any individual could be alone. In ideas, it’s the blending of concepts from different fields to spark innovation and insight.

In people, alloying is the combination of skills that makes them unstoppable. Consider a person possessing deep engineering skills who can clearly explain ideas. They are more valuable than someone with just the engineering skills. Now add empathy, humility, resilience, and drive. This person becomes incredibly rare.

The key to successful alloying is knowing which elements to combine and in what proportions. Too little of one ingredient and you don’t get the desired effect; too much and you might end up with something brittle or unstable. The art lies in finding the sweet spot, the golden ratio where the whole becomes more than the sum of its parts.

Evolution Part One: Natural Selection and Extinction

Natural selection is the hidden hand that selects the fittest from a never-­ending pile of genetic variation, while extinction is the hammer that shatters the unfit and clears the way for variations to arise.

In biology, natural selection is the process by which traits that enhance survival and reproduction become more common in successive generations of a population. The invisible hand of natural selection guides the adaptations of the living world, favoring creatures that are best suited to their environments and pruning back those that fall short.

But for every winner in the great game of natural selection, there are countless losers. Extinction is the fate awaiting those species that fail to adapt, that find themselves outpaced by changing circumstances or outcompeted by more successful forms. The evolutionary end. Without the possibility of extinction, there would be no imperative to evolve to our changing environment. And without the sculpting hand of natural selection, the unfit and ill-­ adapted would consume scarce resources. These principles apply far beyond the realm of biology.

In business, technology, and ideas, we see the same relentless winnowing of the unfit and the elevation of the adaptive. The companies that thrive navigate the shifting landscape of consumer demand and technological change, while those that stagnate are swept away by the tides of creative destruction.

On a personal level, we are all subject to the pressures of selection and the risk of extinction. Our skills, our knowledge, and our ways of thinking must constantly evolve to keep pace with an ever-changing world. Those who consistently adapt are the ones who thrive in the long run.

Above all, remember that there are no permanent victories in the great game of life—­ only the ceaseless striving to stay one step ahead.

Evolution Part Two:  Adaptation and The Red Queen Effect 

Complacency will kill you. There’s no such thing as a permanent lead. No matter how well a species adapts to its environment, it must keep running just to stay in place.

The Red Queen effect results from the never-­ending arms race between predator and prey, parasite and host, and competitor and competitor. As one species evolves a new adaptation, others evolve countermeasures, leading to a constant escalation. The faster you adapt, the faster your rivals must respond, and vice versa. This has profound implications for the pace of evolution.

In a static environment, natural selection might favor a leisurely pace of change. But in a world of constant change, where your competitors are always nipping at your heels, the premium is on speed. The species that thrive adapt quickly and turn the evolutionary crank faster than their rivals. But the Red Queen effect isn’t just about biological evolution. The same principle applies in any competitive domain—­ business, technology, or even ideas.

Companies must continually innovate to stay ahead of their rivals. Technologies must evolve at a breakneck pace to avoid obsolescence. Ideas must adapt and grow to maintain their relevance.

The key is recognizing that adaptation isn’t a one-time event but a continuous process. It’s not about reaching a finish line but maintaining a lead in an endless race. Those who rest on their laurels, who become complacent in their success, are quickly overtaken by hungrier, more agile competitors. But there is a catch when it comes to people.

Once we gain an advantage, we want to hold on to it at all costs, and if we’re not careful, this can slow the pace of adaptation. Before long, our competitors catch up or find innovative ways to neutralize our strength. Sustained success comes from being flexible enough to change, letting go of what worked in the past, and focusing on what you need to thrive in the future.

Standing still is the quickest path to extinction in a world of constant change. Victory goes to those who can continuously adapt.

Ecosystems

Nothing exists in isolation. Everything is connected. The ecosystem lens reveals that each species plays its part in a delicate balance of competition and cooperation. The actions of any one species can have consequences for many others in the same environment.

In biology, an ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment. In an ecosystem, nothing exists in isolation—every creature is both predator and prey, both producer and consumer, locked in an intricate dance of energy and nutrients.

Yet the concept of an ecosystem extends far beyond biology. You can see it nearly everywhere you look. Businesses operate within a complex network of companies, customers, competitors, suppliers, and regulators. Each entity relies on and influences the others, creating a dynamic interplay that determines which businesses thrive and which do not. Economies are also vast ecosystems comprising various sectors (like agriculture, manufacturing, and services) and actors (like workers, consumers, and governments). These components interact under the rules set by economic policies and market forces. Economic theories often explore how changes in one part of the ecosystem can lead to significant outcomes in another, much like the ripple effects seen in biological ecosystems.

What all ecosystems have in common is their inherent complexity and their reductionist analysis. In an ecosystem, the whole is always more than the sum of its parts. The system’s behavior emerges from the countless interactions of its components, often in surprising and unpredictable ways. This suggests that to truly comprehend a complex system, we must look beyond the individual elements and consider the patterns of relationship and feedback that bind them together.

Left to their own devices, many systems can take care of themselves, possessing abilities to correct and compensate for changes and external pressures. No matter how well-intentioned our interventions are, they often lead to unintended consequences as the solution to one problem quickly causes another, more significant problem.

Be slow to intervene, and if you do, take the time to understand how actions in one part cascade into others. It pays to remember the motto of physicians, “First, do no harm.”

Niches

A niche is a special place where a particular species or idea can thrive. It’s the ecological equivalent of a custom-­fitted suit tailored to its occupant’s unique needs and abilities. In a niche, you don’t have to be all things to all people—­ you just have to be the best at what you do.

In biology, a niche is a species’ specific role and position within its ecosystem. It’s the unique combination of resources it consumes, the habitat it lives in, the interactions it has with other species. A place where a species’ adaptations flourish.

But the concept of a niche extends far beyond the realm of ecology. In business, we talk about “market niches”—­ the specific segments of customers with particular needs or preferences. A company focusing on a niche can often out-compete larger, more general rivals by specializing, by becoming the best at serving that particular slice of the market, or by moving with velocity.

The same principle applies to careers. By specializing in something unique and valuable, you can create a space where you can excel and your combination of skills thrives. The key is finding the niche that fits you, rewards your strengths, and neutralizes your weaknesses.

This isn’t to say that occupying a niche is without risks. In fact, you become very fragile. If the environment changes, if consumer preferences shift, a once-­cozy niche can quickly become a tight squeeze. That’s why successful niche occupants are often those who can adapt and evolve their niche as the world around them changes.

Specialists have less competition and stress, but only in times of stability. Generalists face more significant day‑to‑day challenges for resources and survival but have more flexibility to respond when times change.

Self-Preservation 

Self-­ preservation is a core instinct that drives all living things to protect and sustain their own existence. It’s the biological imperative that makes a gazelle run from the lion, the roots of a tree seek water, and bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics. In the game of life, self-­ preservation is the only rule: stay alive.

For humans, self-­ preservation goes beyond physical survival. It encompasses the protection of our psychological well-being, social status, and sense of identity. Anything that threatens how we see ourselves becomes a threat.

While self-­ preservation is a necessary instinct, it can also be limiting. When we’re too focused on avoiding threats, we can easily miss opportunities right before us. Left unchecked, self-preservation can lead to stagnation. The key is to find balance: to protect what’s essential and be willing to let go of what no longer serves us.

Listen to the voice that tells you when to be cautious, but don’t let it be the only voice you hear. Often, the most significant risk is not taking risks at all.

Replication

Replication is the molecular magic trick that allows organisms to make copies of themselves to pass their genetic blueprints from one generation to the next. In the grand ballet of evolution, replication is the music that keeps the dance going.

At its core, replication is about information transfer. It’s the process by which the instructions encoded in DNA are faithfully copied and transmitted. Whenever a cell divides or an organism reproduces, the replication machinery swings into action, ensuring the genetic message is preserved and propagated. However, replication is not a perfect process. Errors creep in, and mutations occur. And it’s these imperfections that fuel the engine of evolution. Without the variation introduced by replication errors, life would stagnate, unable to adapt to changing environments.

Replication is helpful outside of biology, too. As a mental model, it teaches us that we don’t always need to reinvent the wheel. When you’re just starting, the quickest way to make great leaps is to imitate what others are already doing. This establishes an average baseline of performance. Once you get a sense and a feel for the environment, you can innovate and adapt to set a new baseline.

The power of replication lies in its exponential nature. A single replicated entity can give rise to countless copies, each of which can replicate further. This is the power that viruses and viral ideas harness—­ the ability to spread explosively by exploiting the machinery of replication. Memes, beliefs, and practices also replicate, spreading from mind to mind and shaping the contours of our shared reality.

But replication also comes with risks. Unchecked replication can be cancerous, leading to uncontrolled growth that threatens the health of the larger system.

Effective replication requires enough structure and space to produce a copy and enough flexibility to adapt to environmental changes. Just because something has worked for a while doesn’t mean it will be effective in perpetuity. Maintaining a successful approach requires the ability to grow and modify that approach as required.

As we contemplate replication’s role in life and thought, we must recognize its creative and destructive potential. We must create conditions that favor replicating what is true, sound, and beneficial while resisting the spread of what is false, harmful, or malignant.

Cooperation 

Cooperation is the surprising secret of success in the ruthless world of survival. If there is any one model that explains humanity, then this is it. Cooperation unleashed the potential of the human species. 

At first glance, cooperation seems to defy the logic of natural selection. Why would an organism invest its hard-­ earned resources in helping another rather than focusing solely on its own survival and reproduction? The answer lies in the magic of reciprocity and shared interest. When organisms can benefit more by cooperating than by competing, cooperative strategies emerge and flourish. Collaboration with others gives us options and opportunities that are unavailable when we insist on going it alone. 

But cooperation is not automatic. It requires specific conditions—repeated interactions, shared benefits, and mechanisms to prevent cheating. 

Cooperation is the foundation of civilization. Our species’ success is built on our ability to cooperate flexibly and at scale—­ to share knowledge, coordinate efforts, and create institutions that incentivize cooperative behavior. Cooperation underlies our achievements, from the division of labor in the economy to the norms of reciprocity in society. But, as in nature, human cooperation is not guaranteed. It requires constant cultivation and protection from the forces of selfishness and short-­ term thinking. It requires norms that reward cooperation and punish defection.

Hierarchical  Organization

Hierarchy is the invisible scaffolding that organizes the living world. 

Hierarchies in biology aren’t just about structure but about function. They allow for specialization and division of labor, for the emergence of complex behaviors from simple rules. In the hierarchy of an ant colony, the queen, workers, and soldiers all play their roles, their interactions giving rise to the sophisticated operation of the colony as a whole. 

But hierarchy isn’t rigid or fixed. It’s fluid and dynamic, with levels constantly interacting and influencing one another. A change at one level can ripple across the entire hierarchy, transforming the system unexpectedly. 

While hierarchy is a way to manage complexity, it can also backfire. Too much hierarchy leads to unrest and instability. Too little leads to chaos. 

Most organizations promote cultures that emphasize rather than de‑emphasize an individual’s status, power, and place, which is part of the reason they get torn apart, as the fight to get to the top of the hierarchy takes precedence over the organization’s success. 

In the end, hierarchy is the organizing principle that allows scale from the microscopic to the magnificent.

Incentives

Incentives are the hidden engines that drive behavior. They’re the unseen forces that shape our choices, the carrots and sticks that guide our actions. 

Think of a business offering a bonus for hitting a sales target. The bonus is an incentive, the external reward that motivates the salesperson to excel. But incentives aren’t always so obvious. They can be subtle, even subconscious—­ the social approval we seek, the habits we form, the desires we pursue. 

Incentives are powerful because they tap into the fundamental wiring of the human brain. We’re hardwired to seek reward and avoid punishment, to optimize for the outcomes that serve our interests. When the incentives align with our goals, we thrive. When they don’t, we struggle. 

In a classroom, it’s easy to say that we’ll be motivated by doing the right thing; however, in reality, we’re driven mainly by rewards. We have difficulty turning down the pleasure of immediate gains, even if it takes us away from our ultimate goal. 

Often, short-­term and long-­term incentives differ. You might not feel like going to the gym today but want to be healthy as you age. Making choices to maximize your satisfaction today often leads to less reward down the road. 

Poorly designed incentives backfire, encouraging short-­ term thinking, unethical behavior, or unintended consequences. The key is to craft incentives that reward the behaviors that lead to long-­ term success. 

Ultimately, if you understand the incentive, you can predict the outcome. By shaping the incentives, we shape the outcomes. By aligning the incentives, we unlock the power of human potential.

Tendency to Minimize Energy Output (Mental and physical)

The tendency to limit energy output is the universal inclination to follow the path of least resistance. From the flow of a river to the behavior of a market, this tendency is the invisible hand that guides the actions of the world. 

Sometimes, our tendency to conserve energy helps us, and sometimes, it hurts us. While minimizing our output ensures we will have extra to draw on in times of increased need, it can also get in the way of learning. Experience doesn’t become learning without reflection, which is an energy expenditure. 

If we want to develop our thinking and get the most out of our environments, then we have to be aware of the natural tendency to minimize energy output and correct for it where doing so creates value.

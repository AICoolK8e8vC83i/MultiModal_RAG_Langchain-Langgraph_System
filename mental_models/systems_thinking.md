Feedback Loops

Feedback loops are the engines of growth and change. They’re the mechanisms by which the output of a system influences its input.

Complex systems often have many feedback loops, and it can be hard to appreciate how adjusting to feedback in one part of the system will affect the rest.

Using feedback loops as a mental model begins with noticing the feedback you give and respond to daily. The model also provides insight into the value of iterations in adjusting based on the feedback you receive. With this lens, you gain insight into where to direct system changes based on feedback and the pace you need to go to monitor the impacts.

Feedback loops are what make systems dynamic. Without feedback, a system does the same thing over and over. Understand them, respect them, and use them wisely.

Equilibrium

Equilibrium is the state of balance, where opposing forces cancel each other out. It’s the calm in the storm’s center, the stable point around which the chaos swirls. In a system at equilibrium, there’s no net change. Everything is in a steady state, humming along at a constant pace. 

However, systems are rarely static. They continuously adjust toward equilibrium but rarely stay in balance for long. 

Equilibrium is a ­ double-edged sword, both stability and stagnation. In our lives, we often act like we can reach an equilibrium: once we get into a relationship, we’ll be happy; once we move, we’ll be productive; once X thing happens, we’ll be in Y state. But things are always in flux. We don’t reach a certain steady state and then stay there forever. The endless adjustments are our lives. The trick is to find the right balance, strive for equilibrium where it’s needed, and know when to break free and embrace the dis-equilibrium that drives progress.

Bottlenecks

Bottlenecks are the choke points, the narrow parts of the hourglass where everything slows down. They’re the constraints that limit the flow, the weakest links in the chain that determine the strength of the whole. In any system, the bottleneck is the part holding everything else back.

The tricky thing about bottlenecks is that they’re not always obvious. It’s easy to focus on the parts of the system that are moving quickly and assume everything is fine. But the real leverage is in finding and fixing the bottlenecks. Speed up the slowest part, and you speed up the whole system.

This is the theory of constraints in a nutshell. Figure out your bottleneck and focus all your efforts on alleviating it. Don’t waste time optimizing the parts that are already fast. They’re not the limiting factor.

However, bottlenecks aren’t always the villains we make them out to be. Sometimes, they’re a necessary part of the system. Think of a security checkpoint at an airport. It slows everything down, but it’s there for a reason. Remove it, and you might speed things up, but at the cost of safety.

The key is to be intentional about your bottlenecks. Choose them wisely, and make sure they’re serving a purpose. A deliberate bottleneck can be a powerful tool for focusing effort and maintaining quality. An accidental bottleneck is just a drag on the system.

Bottlenecks are leverage points where a little effort can go a long way.

Scale

Systems change as they scale up or down; neither is intrinsically better or worse. The right scale depends on your goals and the context. If you want to scale something up, you need to anticipate that new problems will keep ­ arising—​­ problems that didn’t exist on a smaller scale. Or you might need to keep solving the same problems in different ways.

Think about a recipe. If you’re making a cake for four people, you use a certain amount of ingredients. But if you want to make a cake for four hundred people, you don’t just multiply the ingredients by one hundred. That’s not how scale works. You need to change the process and use bigger mixers and bigger ovens. You need a system that can handle the increased volume without breaking down. 

The challenge with scale is that it’s not always obvious how to achieve it. What works for a small system often breaks down at larger volumes. You have to anticipate the bottlenecks and the points where the system will strain under the increased load. And you have to be ready to re‑engineer your processes as you grow. 

If you’re building something, always be thinking about scale. How will this work when you have ten times as many customers? One hundred times? One thousand times? Build with scale in mind from the start, and you’ll be ready for the growth when it comes.

Margin of Safety 

Margin of safety is a secret weapon. It’s the buffer, the extra capacity, the redundancy that you build into a system to handle unexpected stress. It’s the difference between a bridge that can barely handle the expected load and one that can handle ten times that load without breaking a sweat. 

You can apply a margin of safety to any area of life with uncertainty and risk. The key is always to ask yourself: What if I’m wrong? What if things don’t go as planned? How much extra capacity must I build to handle the unexpected? 

But here’s the rub: margin of safety isn’t free. It means spending more upfront. In the short term, you’ll look overly cautious and leave immediate profits on the table. But in the long run, this apparent overcaution lets you survive when others break – and thrive when others merely survive.

Margin of safety is the unsung hero of ­ long-​­term success. It’s not flashy. It’s not exciting, but it’s the foundation on which everything else is built. Master it, and you’ll be well on your way to navigating the uncertainties of life with confidence and stability.

Churn

Churn is the silent killer of businesses. It’s the slow leak, the constant drip of customers slipping away, of users drifting off to find something new. The attrition eats away at your growth, forcing you to keep running just to stay in place. The thing about churn is that it’s often hidden. It’s not like a sudden crisis that grabs your attention. It’s a slow, quiet process that happens in the background. 

Churn can present opportunity. Like a snake shedding its skin, replacing components of a system is a natural part of keeping it healthy. New parts can improve functionality. 

When we use this model as a lens, we see that new people bring new ideas, and counterintuitively, some turnover allows us to maintain stability. Replacing what is worn out also allows us to upgrade and expand our capabilities, creating new opportunities. Some churn is inevitable. Too much can kill you.

Algorithms

Algorithms are recipes. A list of crisp, unambiguous steps that tell you how to get from point A to point B. But they’re more than just directions. Algorithms are if‑then machines for tuning out the noise and zeroing in on the signal. Have the specs been met? Fol- low the algorithm and find out. Thinking algorithmically means searching for processes that reliably spit out the desired results, like a vending machine dispensing the same candy bar every time someone punches in E4.

Critical mass
Critical mass isn’t just a science term; it’s a guide for understanding that often things happen slowly and then all at once. It’s the moment when a system goes from sputtering along to explosive growth. Like a nuclear chain reaction, once you hit critical mass, the reaction becomes self-sustaining.

Through this lens we gain insight into the amount of material needed for a system to change from one state to another. Material can be anything from people and effort to raw material. When enough material builds up, systems reach their tipping point. When we keep going, we get sustainable change.

Using critical mass as a lens for situations where you want different outcomes helps you identify both the design elements you need to change and the work you need to put in. 

Emergence

Nearly everything is an emergent ­ effect—​­a table, a space shuttle, even ­ us—​­ combinations of ingredients that come together in a specific way to create something new. Emergence is the universe’s way of reminding us that when we combine different pieces in new ways, we get results that are more than the sum of their parts, often in the most unexpected and thrilling ways. 

Using this mental model is not about predicting emergent properties but acknowledging they are possible. There is no need to stick with what you know; mix it up and see what happens. Learn new skills, interact with new people, read new things.

Irreducibility 

Irreducibility is about essence. It’s the idea that some things can’t be broken down into smaller parts without losing what makes them tick. It’s the idea that not everything can be explained by looking at its components. Emergent properties arise from complex systems that can’t be predicted by studying the individual parts. 

Grappling with irreducibility requires a shift in thinking. Instead of trying to break things down, sometimes you have to zoom out. Look at the big picture. Embrace the complexity. Because some problems don’t have neat, modular solutions. They’re irreducibly messy. 

Using irreducibility as a lens helps you focus on what you can change by understanding what really matters

Law of Diminishing Returns

Diminishing returns is the idea that the easy wins usually come first. The more you optimize a system, the harder it gets to eke out additional improvements, like squeezing juice from a lemon. The first squeeze is easy. The second takes a bit more work. By the tenth squeeze, you’re fighting for every last drop. 

Every bit of effort translates into significant gains when you’re a beginner. But as you level up, progress becomes more incremental. It takes more and more work to get better and better. That’s why going from good to great is much harder than going from bad to good. 

Understanding diminishing returns is crucial for allocating resources efficiently. You want to focus on where you can get the biggest bang for your buck. Sometimes, that means knowing when to stop optimizing and move on to something else.

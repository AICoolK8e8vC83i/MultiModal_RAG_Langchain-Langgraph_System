# Surveillance States and AI Ethics

## 🔍 Core Concept

AI systems are increasingly used by governments and corporations for surveillance, social control, and predictive policing. The ethics of AI centers around preventing misuse, ensuring fairness, protecting privacy, and aligning machine behavior with human values in high-stakes environments.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Surveillance capitalism** monetizes behavioral data by predicting and influencing human actions.
- Mass facial recognition systems can infringe on civil liberties and amplify systemic biases.
- Ethical AI must balance **utility, transparency, consent, and accountability**—especially in environments of coercive power.

## 🚀 Applications

- Designing **privacy-preserving models** using federated learning or differential privacy.
- Building explainable AI (XAI) that resists misuse in authoritarian regimes or corporate surveillance systems.

## 📌 Prompt Examples

- “What are the dangers of facial recognition in public spaces?”
- “How can we design AI systems that resist authoritarian misuse?”
- “Give examples of ethical dilemmas in AI deployment.”

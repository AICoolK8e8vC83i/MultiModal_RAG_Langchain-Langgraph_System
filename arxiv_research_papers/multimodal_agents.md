# Multimodal Intelligence

## 🔍 Core Concept

Multimodal intelligence is the ability of an AI system to process, understand, and generate insights from multiple input types—text, image, audio, video, and even sensor data. Unlike unimodal models, multimodal systems mirror human perception by integrating diverse data streams for deeper context and more accurate decision-making.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- CLIP and BLIP use **contrastive learning** and **vision-language pretraining** to align visual and textual embeddings.
- Transformers can handle multimodal sequences when properly tokenized and embedded in shared representation space.
- True intelligence comes from **modality fusion**—not just parallel processing, but **context-aware cross-attention**.

## 🚀 Applications

- AI assistants that can see, hear, and read to offer holistic help.
- Real-time content summarizers that understand audio-visual lectures or meetings.

# Reinforcement Learning and Agentic AI

## 🔍 Core Concept

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where agents learn by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. Agentic AI refers to systems that display autonomous, goal-driven behaviors, often powered by RL, memory modules, and reasoning engines. Together, they enable adaptable, intelligent agents capable of long-term planning.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- RL is based on **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)** and uses **value functions** or **policy gradients** to optimize behavior.
- Deep RL integrates **neural networks** (e.g., DQN, PPO, A3C) to handle high-dimensional inputs like vision or natural language.
- Agentic AI systems combine planning, memory, and reasoning to achieve emergent autonomy—going beyond simple stimulus-response loops.

## 🚀 Applications

- Building productivity agents that dynamically adapt based on user behavior.
- Real-time robotics, recommendation systems, trading bots, and AGI prototypes.

# Quantum Cognitive Theory (Light, Digestible)

## 🔍 Core Concept

Quantum cognitive theory applies principles from quantum mechanics to model human thought and decision-making—especially under uncertainty or ambiguity. Rather than literal particles in the brain, this approach leverages mathematical formalisms (e.g., superposition, entanglement, interference) to capture how humans think, perceive, and resolve contradictions in novel ways.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Superposition**: Thoughts or beliefs may exist in overlapping states (e.g., doubt + belief) before collapsing into a decision.
- **Entanglement**: Concepts can become interdependent—thinking of one changes the probability of another.
- **Quantum interference** explains why people often defy classical logic in probability and decision tasks.

## 🚀 Applications

- Modeling user intent and ambiguity in AI agents.
- Designing decision-making systems that mimic human-like contradiction handling.

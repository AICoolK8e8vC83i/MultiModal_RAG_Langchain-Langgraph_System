# Subliminals and Self-Modification

## 🔍 Core Concept

Subliminals refer to audio, visual, or subconscious stimuli designed to bypass conscious awareness and influence beliefs, behaviors, or even physical traits. Self-modification is the broader process of intentionally reprogramming one's thoughts, appearance, and habits using tools like affirmations, neuroplasticity, and deep focus.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Repetition of specific frequencies and affirmations can strengthen neural circuits.
- The subconscious accepts consistent stimuli as "truth" and reshapes identity accordingly.
- Subliminals work best when paired with sleep optimization, hydration, and inner visualization.

## 🚀 Applications

- Daily listening to targeted audio scripts (e.g., for clear skin, confidence, height growth).
- Visual reinforcement using manhwa-style templates for aesthetic visualization.

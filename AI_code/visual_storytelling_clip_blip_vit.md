# Visual Storytelling with CLIP, BLIP, and ViT

## 🔍 Core Concept

Visual storytelling in AI combines vision models like CLIP, BLIP, and Vision Transformers (ViT) with language generation to interpret, narrate, and contextualize images or videos. These models allow machines to "see" with semantic precision and respond intelligently to visual stimuli.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **CLIP** (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining) aligns image and text embeddings in a shared space using contrastive learning.
- **BLIP** enhances this with **captioning and VQA (Visual Question Answering)** via multimodal transformers.
- **ViT** (Vision Transformer) processes image patches as token sequences for deep feature extraction.

## 🚀 Applications

- AI agents that describe scenes, generate captions, or answer questions about uploaded images.
- Multimodal retrieval systems: search for images using text or generate text from images.

## 📌 Prompt Examples

- “How does CLIP match a caption to an image?”
- “What’s the difference between ViT and CNNs in image understanding?”
- “Give 2 real-world uses for visual captioning models.”

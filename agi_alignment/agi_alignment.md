# AGI and AI Alignment

## 🔍 Core Concept

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to an AI system capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can do. AI alignment is the challenge of ensuring that such powerful systems act in accordance with human values, ethics, and long-term safety.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- AGI is not merely about scaling models—it requires integrating memory, reasoning, perception, and autonomous goals.
- Misaligned AGI could result in catastrophic outcomes if its objectives diverge from human values.
- Alignment strategies include RLHF, Constitutional AI, interpretability research, and human-in-the-loop oversight.

## 🚀 Applications

- Incorporating ethical guardrails into powerful LLMs to reduce hallucinations and bias.
- Developing cognitive architectures that balance utility with human preferences.
